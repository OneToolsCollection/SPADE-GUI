NVIDIA SPADE GUI tool, recreated and enhanced.

This is a recreation of the NVIDIA SPADE [demonstration app](https://youtu.be/p5U4NgVGAwg) they showed at GTC 2019 for fun. It will do everything that the demonstration app could do, which is take a MS Paint-like input from the user and convert it in semi-real time to a photorealistic image. It will first function using the ADE20K pretrained model released, and may eventually support the COCO-Stuff dataset model.

The Flickr Landscapes (40k) dataset shown in the video was not open sourced by NVIDIA and as such will likely not be supported, unless folks who trained the model themselves would be willing to share.
